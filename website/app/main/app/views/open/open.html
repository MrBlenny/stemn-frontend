            <p class="text-subtitle-thin-lg">Great science and engineering results from a process of constant iteration and relentless refinement. Engineering is fundamentally collaborative. We believe that the best ideas grow and expand with the input of others.</p>
            <p class="text-subtitle-thin-lg">Open engineering is not just about the final result. It is about sharing your process; the hours of missteps and false starts you tore through, the frustration and anguish you pushed beyond, before you arrived at that final iteration. Each of those false starts is a learning experience, a teachable moment to invite others to understand not just what you designed; but how you did so.</p>
            <p class="text-subtitle-thin-lg">Working in the open can be frightening. Exposing your work to critique requires bold effort. But with the collective, collaborative genius, together we can push the boundaries and create better work.</p>
