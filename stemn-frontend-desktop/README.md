# Stemn Frontend Desktop

Anyone can get the [Stemn Desktop App](https://stemn.com/download) running locally and develop new features. The entire frontend is open-source!

### Install
1. Make sure you have `git` and `node` installed.
2. Clone the parent repo: `stemn-frontend`.
3. `cd` into this folder (stemn-frontend-desktop) and run `npm run install`
4. If you are using WSL, run `npm run install:electron:wsl`

## Build Development

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

* `npm run start:electron` to start the electron build server
* `npm run start:renderer` tol start the renderer build server

Then, in a 3rd terminal, start electron

* `npm run electron`

## Deploy

Note:
Only members of the Stemn Team can deploy - open source devs will need to submit a PR.

Releasing depends on 3 different repos.
Releases are compiled in the cloud by AppVeyor and TravisCI.

People with access should:

1. Bump the version in the `package.json` AND `app/package.json`
2. Build the app using `npm run build` - make sure it works using `npm run electron`
3. Create a new tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stemn/Stemn-Desktop/releases)
4. `npm run deploy`. This will copy the dist, copy into the release repo and push it up to the CI servers.
5. Monitor CI status at [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MrBlenny/stemn-desktop) and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Stemn/Stemn-Desktop)
6. Releases will appear on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stemn/Stemn-Desktop/releases). Test these releases.
7. Publish the releases on GitHub.
8. Finally, run `update.sh/bat` in the [Stemn-Updates](https://github.com/Stemn/Stemn-Updates) repo. This will bump the numbers in `updates.json`
